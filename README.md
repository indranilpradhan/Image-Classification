# Image-Classification

1. Given CiFAR-10 dataset, implement a linear SVM classifier to predict the classes
of the test images.
2. Featurize the images as vectors that can be used for classification.
3. Report your observations for different values of C. Explain the significance of C.
4. Compare and contrast the classifier with the KNN classifier built in the previous
assignment.
5. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
useful.
6. Report the support vector images in each case.
7. (Bonus-20 points) You may do some processing on the train set to improve your
scores on linear SVM. Report your changes clearly.
8. You can use inbuilt functions for SVM.
